# C pre-processor magic, revisited (W.I.P.)

Macros are almost always discouraged, but they are far from rare in production code. Therefore, it is of interest to explore their pitfalls, limitations, and compliance with the C-standard and others. In this article, I will analyse the macros introduced by the articles [C pre-processor magic][1][[1]], [C Preprocessor tricks, tips, and idioms][2][[2]] and [Is the C preprocessor Turing complete?][3][[2]], complementing the information there provided.
